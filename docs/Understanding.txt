So first I downloaded python on my machine as well as pandas and nba_api
Next I use vscode to imported the leaguedashplayerstats endpoint from nba_api.stats.endpoints
once I did that I created an object which filtered the player stats by the latest complete season (24-25) and used only the regular season
