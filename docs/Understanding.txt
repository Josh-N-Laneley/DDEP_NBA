So first I downloaded python on my machine as well as pandas and nba_api
Next I use vscode to imported the leaguedashplayerstats endpoint from nba_api.stats.endpoints
once I did that I created an object which filtered the player stats by the latest complete season (24-25) and used only the regular season


I had some trouble with the raw data - the names with accents were appearing incorrectly
After some research Idiscovered this was a file encoding issue
To fix this I 


“I encountered character encoding mismatches between UTF-8 API responses and downstream consumers and resolved it by enforcing encoding standards at export.”
Resolved text encoding challenges (é, è, etc.) when saving NBA player stats to CSV for downstream use, ensuring clean UTF-8 output compatible with Excel and SQL ingestion.
